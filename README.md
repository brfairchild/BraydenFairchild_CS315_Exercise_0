### Activity Report

Followed the tutorial provided by Godot, the purpose of this exercise was the familiarize ourselves with the Godot engine. This project has us creating a playable character along with randomly spawning enemies on a path that will then move that the player will have to dodge, alone with this we have also created HUD elements and how to connect them to code.


### Revision Report

Fixed named convention

> I did not realize the course schedule has a different tab for excercises that shows the steps and names that we should use for the project, this led to me not selection the correct naming convention.

> To fix this when I realized there was another tab for the course schedule I read through it and found the correct way to name the projects.

Added README.md

> I was not thinking and I forgot about adding the README.md to the file. 

> The correction I have made was to create and fill out the README.md.

Added Assets Used to correctly display the license 

> I was paying too much attention to the tutorial and when I finished the tutorial I thought it was completed and turned it in without checking.

> The corrections I have made was to correctly display the license in the README.md file along with a link to the used resources.

Completed the Activity Report

> I did not realize there were more steps to be completed after finishing the tutorial and I turn it in without looking or checking to make sure.

> After discovering the pages about exercises I went back into the project and made sure everything was set up correctly and filled out the activity report.
